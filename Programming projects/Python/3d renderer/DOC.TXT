This is a 3d renderer in python turtle, the code was made by my friend, and I made this DOC!

You can us it to make cool shapes, sadly I haven't added the rotation feature yet, that may be a bit complicated and will
require my amazing organisation skills

IMPORTANT: Start every new file with the setup() and end with end()
If you wish to change the camera position, this can be done by going into the renderer code
The "connect()" function connects all the points together that you put into a list,
    e.g. connect([point1, point2, point3])

Making points:
    make an x, y and z co-ordinate for your point,

        e.g. point1 = point(100, 50, 30)

    NOTE, you need to set the point to a variable

Making a line:
    use the line function to draw a line between 2 points, like this,

        e.g. line(line1, line2)


A full code example would look like this,

    setup()

    line1 = point(0, 0, 0)
    line2 = point(100, 50, 75)

    line(line1, line2)

    end()

Good luck!
