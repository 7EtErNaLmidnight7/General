- Use the "setup()" command to start the file 
- Use the "draw()" to draw the graph, make a list of the points e.g. "draw([69, 420])" 
- End with "end()"
- Feel free to configure the setup function in the backend 
- You can enter an index into the terminal, and it will return the value of that point :) 

**Have fun**
